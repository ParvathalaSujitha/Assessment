Hi sir/madam,

I am writing to you regarding the recent assessment that you asked me to complete in both Java and C languages.
As a Java developer, I took up the challenge of writing the code in both languages and have submitted it as per your request.

I want to assure you that I have a strong background and efficient knowledge in Java programming language, which I have gained through various experiences and projects. 
However, I am aware that there is always room for learning and improvement. That being said, I am open to learning new programming languages and skills.

Although I may not have as much experience in C language as I have in Java, I am willing to put in the effort to learn and grow my skills in this area.
I am excited about the opportunity to expand my knowledge and work with new technologies.

Thank you for considering my assessment submission. I appreciate the opportunity to learn and grow in my career.

Best regards,
Parvathala Sujitha.
